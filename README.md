# Air-Boltic

The repo consists of the following components:
  1.A dbt core project created using a dbt-databricks configuration 
  2.A delta_tables_script.sql file that serves as an example of how Delta tables would be created in a Databricks Workspace using a made up S3 storage location where the raw data would be stored.
  3.A LoomkL file containing an explore configuration that would use the final datamart from dbt as a source to power Looker.
  4.The raw data folder containing the provided CSVs and JSON sample data for reference.

**Please see the following context document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W04gBfo_bpGOIeDRofLLMP1Sk-_qe_6f2Auk6QofioI/edit?tab=t.0) for more information on the solution for both Part 1 and Part 2 as well as the ERD diagram.
